//! # mrusty. mruby safe bindings for Rust
//!
//! ## Requirements
//! * [mruby](https://github.com/mruby/mruby)
//!
//! mrusty requires mruby compiled with `fPIC`. To compile and install mruby 1.2.0:
//!
//! * make sure you have [Bison](https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/)
//! & [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) installed
//! * download the [source](https://github.com/mruby/mruby/archive/1.2.0.zip)
//! * unzip and `cd` to `mruby-1.2.0/`
//! * add the following lines to `build_config.rb` as in the `# C compiler settings`
//! example (make sure you add it after the comment):
//! ```ruby
//! conf.cc do |cc|
//!   cc.flags << '-fPIC'
//! end
//! ```
//! * run `./minirake`
//! * copy header files from `include` to `/usr/loca/include`
//! * copy `build/host/lib/libmruby.a` to `/usr/local/lib`
//!
//! *Note:* On OSX you can install it from homebrew with `brew install mruby`.
